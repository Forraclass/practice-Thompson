## Ginger Root
The sub genre **city-pop** does not have many main stream creators nowadays and I appreciate its ambient qualities, particularly Ginger Root's at the moment. I discovered the band last semester and it has remained in my favorites from then to now. In fact, I am listening to them right now as I write this paragraph. The tracks **"Loretta" and "Jubal District"** from the album *City Slicker* are my top picks from their work.
