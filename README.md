## Ginger Root
The sub genre **city-pop** does not have many main stream creators nowadays and I appreciate its ambient qualities, particularly Ginger Root's at the moment. I discovered the band last semester and it has remained in my favorites from then to now. In fact, I am listening to them right now as I write this paragraph. The tracks **"Loretta" and "Jubal District"** from the album *City Slicker* are my top picks from their work.

>Life is just a bowl of cherries
>Don't take it serious, it's too mysterious
>You work, you save, you worry so
>But you can't take your dough when you go, go, go

>So keep repeating it's the berries
>The strongest oak must fall
>The sweet things in life, to you were just loaned
>So how can you lose what you've never owned?
